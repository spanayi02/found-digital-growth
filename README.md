# FOUND. Local Digital Growth Company

Production website and lead-management application for FOUND., a Cyprus-based local digital growth company. It includes the public marketing site, website-audit and contact conversion flows, persistent lead records, a protected admin area, email and webhook integrations, consent-aware analytics, SEO routes and structured data.

## Stack

- Next.js App Router, deployed on Vercel
- React 19, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Supabase Postgres with Drizzle ORM and versioned migrations
- Zod validation on every public and admin write route
- Resend REST API for notification and confirmation email
- Vercel BotID, honeypot and server-side rate limiting
- ChatGPT sign-in for protected admin routes
- Google Analytics 4 after explicit analytics consent

## Local setup

Requirements: Node.js 22.13 or later, npm, and a Supabase project (for `DATABASE_URL`).

For Windows and Visual Studio Code, follow `SETUP-WINDOWS.md`. The included
`setup-windows.ps1` script installs dependencies, creates the local environment
file, applies the database migration and inserts the initial settings.

1. Create a Supabase project and copy its Postgres connection string.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `DATABASE_URL` plus any other values needed for local testing.
3. Run `npm ci`.
4. Run `npm run db:generate` after schema changes.
5. Run `npm run db:migrate` to apply migrations to the Supabase database.
6. Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:3000.

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: local development server
- `npm run build`: production Next.js build
- `npm run start`: run the built Next.js app
- `npm run lint`: ESLint
- `npm run typecheck`: strict TypeScript checking
- `npm test`: production build plus automated tests
- `npm run db:generate`: generate a migration from `db/schema.ts`
- `npm run db:migrate`: apply migrations to the Supabase Postgres database
- `npm run db:seed`: apply the optional local seed file when present
- `npm run db:studio`: open Drizzle Studio when the environment supports it

## Environment configuration

Public settings use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only when the browser needs them. Secrets stay server-side.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: canonical production origin
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_EMAIL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTACT_PHONE`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`: central contact details
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`: GA4 measurement ID
- `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO`: Resend email delivery. `EMAIL_TO` accepts a comma-separated list of team recipients for every new Contact or Free Audit submission; the person submitting the form also receives an automatic confirmation.
- `LEAD_WEBHOOK_URL`: optional n8n, Make, Zapier, HubSpot or custom CRM endpoint
- `ADMIN_EMAILS`: comma-separated ChatGPT account emails allowed into `/admin`
- optional Instagram and LinkedIn URLs

Set `ADMIN_EMAILS` to the two administrators' sign-in emails, separated by a comma. An empty list denies everyone, including local development users. Both administrators have the same permissions. Email matching ignores case and surrounding spaces.

Production authentication currently requires the Sites authentication gateway to supply trusted identity headers and strip client-supplied identity headers. Do not expose this application directly on another host without replacing that authentication boundary. The email allowlist authorizes an authenticated identity; it does not verify the identity itself.

## Database and admin

The production database is a Supabase Postgres project, connected through `DATABASE_URL`. The schema stores leads, audit requests, newsletter subscribers and settings. Generated SQL in `drizzle/` is applied with `npm run db:migrate`.

The admin area uses ChatGPT sign-in and a server-side email allowlist. It includes dashboard metrics, local search and status filters, lead details, pipeline status, HOT/WARM/COLD priority, estimated value, notes, deletion, CSV export and manual audit scoring out of 100.

## Email, webhooks and spam protection

Create and verify a sending domain in Resend, then configure `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` and `EMAIL_TO`. Add every internal recipient to `EMAIL_TO`, separated by commas. A successful public submission is written to Postgres first. Email or webhook failure is isolated so a saved enquiry is not lost.

Public form endpoints are protected by Vercel BotID, which runs invisibly and needs no keys. It only classifies traffic on Vercel deployments; locally every request is treated as human. The hidden honeypot and rate limiter remain active.

## Analytics and consent

GA4 loads only after the visitor accepts analytics. The central event utility supports contact, audit, service, project, phone, WhatsApp, booking and pricing events. UTM source, medium, campaign, content and term values are retained for the session and saved with enquiries.

## Production checklist

1. Replace placeholder phone and email details.
2. Set the final canonical domain.
3. Configure `ADMIN_EMAILS`.
4. Verify the Resend sending domain.
5. Add the GA4 measurement ID if analytics is required.
6. Add an optional CRM webhook.
7. Have the Privacy Policy, Terms and client agreement reviewed by a Cyprus-qualified legal professional.
8. Confirm real social URLs before setting them.
9. Test a contact enquiry, audit request, confirmation email, admin update and CSV export after launch.
